# native

[![test](https://github.com/crgimenes/native/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crgimenes/native/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Small, focused Go packages that bind native OS and hardware APIs **without cgo**.

Each package fills one gap the standard library leaves open: clipboard, desktop
notifications, file-system watching, serial ports, mmap. A clean Go API on top, a
per-platform backend underneath. No C toolchain, no bundled native libraries. The
backends call what the OS already ships, through
[`purego`](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego), `syscall`,
`dlopen`/`LoadLibrary`, the Objective-C runtime, COM, and D-Bus.

Sibling of [glaze](https://github.com/crgimenes/glaze), the pure-Go WebView
binding, and it comes from the same bet: you can port genuinely hairy native
integration to Go and keep what cgo otherwise takes away. `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds,
six `GOOS/GOARCH` targets cross-compiled from one machine, reproducible output,
and a `go install` that works for whoever clones the repo with no compiler set
up.

## Philosophy

- **Small over sprawling.** One package, one job. No "parallel stdlib", no
  god-package. Each directory here is independently useful and independently
  testable, but they compose into a real desktop app when used together.
- **Idiomatic Go at the seams.** The public API is plain Go: `string`, `[]byte`,
  `error`, small option structs. Native handles (`objc.ID`, COM vtables, `HWND`,
  file descriptors) never leak across the package boundary, so the
  Win32/Cocoa/portal backend can change without touching callers.
- **Zero cgo, always.** `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds and cross-compiles for every
  supported target.
- **Honest about platforms.** Where a platform genuinely can't do something
  cheaply (Linux clipboard ownership, Wayland global hotkeys), the package
  returns a clear sentinel error and the README says so, rather than pretending.

## Non-goals

Deliberately *not* attempted here. These are maintenance black holes, or already
well-served elsewhere:

- A complete GUI toolkit (use glaze + HTML, or a real toolkit).
- Full audio engines / DSP, Vulkan/Metal/WebGPU, generic USB stacks.
- "Perfect" Wayland coverage. macOS and Windows are tractable; Linux desktop is
  fragmented and gets best-effort, portal-first support.

### Lives in glaze, not here

Features that need the application's window/run loop belong in the desktop
framework, [glaze](https://github.com/crgimenes/glaze):

- **Native application menus**: the macOS menu bar, About/Preferences/Quit,
  window menus on Windows/Linux (shipped as `glaze/menu`).

File dialogs started out on that list, but standalone panels turned out not to
need the host window: they live here as [`filedialog`](filedialog/), and the
caller is responsible for invoking them on the main thread.

The standalone packages above are imported *by* glaze; they don't depend on it.

## Conventions

Every package follows the same shape so they're predictable to use and to write:

- **One package per directory**, named for the job (`clipboard`, `serial`).
- **Platform split by build tags / filenames**: `foo_darwin.go`,
  `foo_windows.go`, `foo_linux.go` — or a single `foo_unix.go` where one POSIX
  backend covers them all (`mmap`, `singleinstance`) — plus a `foo_other.go`
  fallback stub, so the module always builds for every `GOOS`.
- **Public API in a tag-free file** (`foo.go`): doc comments, exported types,
  and sentinel errors live there and delegate to unexported per-platform funcs.
- **Sentinel errors**, e.g. `var ErrUnsupported = errors.New("clipboard: not supported on this platform")`.
  Where an error would be noise the package documents a zero value instead
  (`filedialog` returns `""` both on cancel and on an unsupported platform).
- **No native types in signatures.** Inputs/outputs are Go values.
- **A package `README.md`** (API table, per-platform status, caveats) **and a
  runnable example** in `examples/<pkg>/`, same module, no extra deps. See
  [`clipboard`](clipboard/) for the shape.
- **`golangci-lint` clean on every `GOOS`.** The `unsafe.Pointer(uintptr)` that
  `go vet`'s `unsafeptr` flags (common with purego, e.g. a `GlobalLock` pointer)
  goes through a `ptr(u uintptr) unsafe.Pointer` reinterpret helper. Same bits,
  same ABI, spelled that way only to quiet `go vet`.

### ABI discipline (the part that bites)

cgo's pointer rules still apply conceptually even without cgo. The scars, learned
porting glaze's three backends:

- **No Go pointer is ever held by native code.** The GC can move Go memory. Pass
  an integer id, keep a `map[id]*T` on the Go side, resolve it in the callback.
- **Anything handed to native code must stay alive and unmovable.** Keep it in a
  package-level slice/map (callback trampolines, COM vtables).
- **Struct-by-value is architecture-specific.** A 16-byte struct goes by hidden
  reference on Win64 amd64 but packs into registers on arm64 (AAPCS64), so it
  needs `*_amd64.go` / `*_arm64.go`. **This does not show up in cross-compilation;
  it compiles clean and breaks at runtime.**
- **`purego.NewCallback` on Windows** is limited: ≤9 uintptr args, no float /
  struct-by-value, single uintptr return. Design inbound callbacks within that.
- **Thread affinity.** GUI/COM APIs are pinned to a thread (Cocoa → real main
  thread; GTK → the `gtk_init` thread; COM apartment + pump → its thread). Use
  `runtime.LockOSThread` and route cross-thread calls through a dispatch.

## Testing reality

ABI bugs do not appear in cross-compilation. You have to run on the target.
CI (GitHub Actions) builds, vets and tests on macOS, Windows and Linux runners,
runs `make cross` to compile-check every `GOOS/GOARCH`, and runs golangci-lint
across each `GOOS`. Where a package has a backend on the runner its tests run for
real (`clipboard`'s round trip on macOS and Windows); where it doesn't, they skip
(`clipboard` on Linux, for now) instead of failing. A file that says
`// UNTESTED on this host` means exactly that: it compiles, but no human or CI on
that OS has confirmed it yet.

Hardware is the final word. A real GNOME desktop ships GTK3 and GTK4 side by
side; a CI runner carries exactly one stack. That gap hid a `gtk_init` crash in
glaze until it ran on an actual Ubuntu box, so single-stack CI is necessary but
not sufficient.
